# Project Title: Réalisez une étude de santé publique avec Python


## Introduction
This project aims to conduct a public health study using Python. The study focuses on analyzing various health-related datasets to derive meaningful insights and conclusions.

## Project Overview
The project uses several datasets located in the `src/main/datasets/` directory. These datasets include information about food aid, food availability, population, and malnutrition. The project uses Python and various libraries to process and analyze these datasets.
